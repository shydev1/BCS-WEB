            The official uniform of the Brotherhood of the Cross and Star is white garment with cape known officially as the “soutane” in conformity with what is recorded in revelation of John the Divine “…And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes and whence came they? And I said unto him, sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, these are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the lamb. Therefore, are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple; and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them” (Rev. 7:13-15) “And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white; for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.; (Rev. 19:8)

            <h6 style={{ color: "#333", padding: 30, }}  className="">
            BCS members knock (bow) their head three times in reverence to the Holy Trinity God, before and after prayers or that any time, place or occasion whenever the spirit directs. Knocking of head is a very vital and effective part of communication with God; It is akin to a dialing tone or knocking on the door before going in.

            <h6 style={{ color: "#333", padding: 30, }}  className="">
            It is the doctrine of the Brotherhood of the Cross and Star not to wear shoes into the Bethels or the house of worship, In recognition and reverence of the holiness and presence of God.
“then said the lord to him, put off thy shoes from thy feet; for the place where thou standest is Holy ground”.  “God is holy and all worshippers of God must worship Him in spirit and in truth”. 
Acts 7:33, Exodus 3:5, Romans 10:15, Luke 22-35, Luke 10:4, Luke 9:3

            <h6 style={{ color: "#333", padding: 30, }}  className="">
            “Peace of the Father”,” Perfect Peace” or “Peace be unto you;” is the general opening greetings of BCS members irrespective of time or occasion. Peace is a heavenly language. Our Lord Jesus Christ is the Prince of Peace. He used the same greetings of “peace” and his disciples followed suit in their evangelism, and after His ascension.

            <h6 style={{ color: "#333", padding: 30, }}  className="">
            Everybody must pay one tenth of his/her earning as the tithe of God. Bethels, Associations, and fellowships must pay tithe from proceeds realized from functions. The tithe payment is a secret between you and your God. Malachi 3:7-12

            “Everybody from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you saith the LORD of host. “But ye said, wherein shall we return? Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed me! But you say, Wherein have we robbed thee?” in the tithe and offerings. Ye are cursed with a curse, for ye have robbed me; even this whole nation. Bring ye all the tithe into the storehouse, that there may be meat in my house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of host, “If I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it. And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground, neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts. And all nations call you blessed: for ye shall be delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts.” Malachi 3:6-12

            <h6 style={{ color: "#333", padding: 30, }}  className="">
            If you have been joking with the tithe belonging to God by way of not paying regularly or using same for personal or group purposes, stop forthwith otherwise your condition will get worst. You attract great blessings when you pay your tithe regularly.
