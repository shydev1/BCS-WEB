        The Book of Genesis chapters 1 and 2 reveals that everything one beholds in the world including man was created by God with the words of His mouth. The Gospel of John chapter 1 verses 1 to 15 substantiated this, even with the inclusion that the word itself became flesh and lived in the world with man.

        <h6 style={{ color: "#333", padding: 10, }}  className="font-">
        Even when Adam and Eve faltered, it took the same word to alter things. Therefore, in this last dispensation, the recreation and reconstruction of everything including the fallen man is through the word of God. And this is why the Holy Writ did say, “And this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come” (Matt. 24: 14).

        In this last dispensation, The Ancient of Days, Great Leader Olumba Olumba Obu, The Sole Spiritual Head of the Universe and His Christ, His Holiness Olumba Olumba Obu, The King of kings and The Lord of lords who bodily constitute The Holy Trinity are here on earth with man. The Everlasting Gospel, that is, His holy word, is being preached and of necessity must reach to every nooks and crannies of the world, so that mankind would have no excuse (Rev. 14: 6-7). This forms the foundation to the establishing of this Media House and Newspaper called, “THE NEW KINGDOM TRUMPET” by The Holy Father as an outreach to the depraved man and world. Is it not written in 1 Thessalonians 4: 16 that, “For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first”?
